# Hack day: Mastermind challenge :key:

## ...........Challenge................:lock: 
This repository contains the implementation of the mastermind game, this is a board game, of ingenuity and reflection, at first this version only allows the interaction of one player, later in version 2 it will be multiplayer. It is played on a board with small white and red chips and other colors, somewhat larger in size. The player, taking colored tiles from the same set, ventures a possibility answered with red (well placed color tiles) or white (color tiles with the correct color, but wrongly placed).

It ends when the combination is found (that is, a combination with four reds is achieved), or the board is exhausted (it depends on the size, although there are generally 10 combinations).
